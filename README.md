# c9800-RESTCONF

## Abstract

C9800 can be accessed from RESTCONF using YANG model. But YANG model is very difficult to find the correct url and parameters. So I created the C9800 API wrapper. This is useful for the c9800 API beginner.

## How to use

### Setup config.json
You need to input parameter according to your environment.

### import getApInfo.py to your code
Reffering to the sample_code.py
